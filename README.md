# ElasticLine

**ElasticLine** is a customizable React component that animates a bending line with text, providing a dynamic visual effect on mouse movement. This component is built using React and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), and is designed for use in modern web applications with Vite.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance:** Easily change line color, text color, font size, and more through props.
- **Dynamic Animation:** The line bends in response to mouse movements, creating an engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The component adjusts its size based on the container dimensions.
- **SVG Text Path:** Utilizes SVG for smooth text animations along the bending line.

## Installation

To install the ElasticLine component, run:

```bash
npm install elastic-line
